function ret = getdrives(varargin)
%GETDRIVES  Get the drive letters of all mounted filesystems.
%   F = GETDRIVES returns the roots of all mounted filesystems as a cell
%   array of char arrays.
%   
%   On Windows systems, this is a list of the names of all single-letter 
%   mounted drives.
%
%   On Unix systems (including Macintosh) this is the single root
%   directory, /.
% 
%   F = GETDRIVES('-nofloppy') does not scan for the a: or b: drives on
%   Windows, which usually results in annoying grinding sounds coming from
%   the floppy drive.
%   
%   F = GETDRIVES('-twoletter') scans for both one- AND two-letter drive
%   names on Windows.  While two-letter drive names are technically supported,
%   their presence is in fact rare, and slows the search considerably.
%
%   Note that only the names of MOUNTED volumes are returned.  In 
%   particular, removable media drives that do not have the media inserted 
%   (such as an empty CD-ROM drive) are not returned.
%
